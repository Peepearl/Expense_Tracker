# Expense_Tracker
A simple command-line Expense Tracker built with Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help users record, view, and calculate their total expenses.
### Aim
The aim of this project is to create a simple command-line Expense Tracker using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to manage their daily expenses by recording, viewing, and calculating totals in an easy-to-use terminal interface.

### Project Overview
This Python project simulates a basic expense management tool that runs in the command line. It helps users track how much they spend by adding expenses with a name, amount, and category. All expenses are stored in memory, and the user can view all added expenses or check the total at any time. The project is structured using two main classes: Expense and ExpenseTracker.
It demonstrates how core OOP concepts like class creation, objects, and method interaction can be applied in a real-world scenario.

### Features
- Add new expenses with details (name, amount, category)
- View a list of all recorded expenses
- Automatically calculate and display total expenses
- Validate input (e.g., only numbers accepted for amount)

### Lesson Learnt
- How to define and use custom Python classes
- The importance of object-oriented programming for organizing code
- How to use __str__() to display readable object details
- Basic error handling with try-except for user input
- Building a menu-driven application in the terminal
- Better understanding of loops, lists, and functions working together
